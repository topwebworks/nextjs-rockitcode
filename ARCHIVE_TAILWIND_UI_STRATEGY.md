  compass_only: {
    investment_used: '$25 (8% of $299)';
    components_available: '~15 basic components';
    development_speed: 'Slow - building everything custom';
    design_quality: 'Good - but limited patterns';
    competitive_advantage: 'Minimal - basic course template';
  };
  
  full_library: {
    investment_used: '$299 (100% utilization)';
    components_available: '500+ professional components';
    development_speed: 'Fast - copy/paste proven patterns';
    design_quality: 'Excellent - professional design system';
    competitive_advantage: 'Significant - superior to competitors';
  };
}
```

## **üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Week 1: Component Audit & Extraction**
