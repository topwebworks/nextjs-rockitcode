## üîÑ **MAINTENANCE STRATEGY**

### **Preservation Rules**
1. **NEVER modify** `src/components/catalyst/` - UI Kit Catalyst protected
2. **Always check** latest Tailwind Plus updates before adding components
3. **Maintain consistency** in file structure and naming
4. **Document changes** in this roadmap

### **Update Process**
1. Scrape latest Tailwind Plus code
2. Compare with existing components
3. Update/create components as needed
4. Test integration with existing codebase
5. Update roadmap progress

---

## üéØ **NEXT ACTIONS**

### **Immediate Priority**
1. **Choose Phase 1 section** to implement next (Pricing recommended)
2. **Scrape latest data** for chosen section
3. **Create components** following established patterns
4. **Update roadmap** with progress

### **Strategic Considerations**
- Focus on **high-impact sections first** (Pricing, Headers)
- Maintain **quality over quantity**
- Consider **project-specific needs** when prioritizing
- Plan for **future scalability** and maintenance
