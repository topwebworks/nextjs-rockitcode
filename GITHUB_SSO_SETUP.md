# GitHub SSO Setup for AOP-Marketing Organization

## Current Issue
Your work GitHub account (https://github.com/AOP-Marketing) requires organization approval for OAuth apps.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check OAuth App Authorization

**Your GitHub OAuth App:** `Ov23li4nuXpq2JjkREnk`

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/applications
2. **Look for:** "Rockitcode" application 
3. **Check:** Organization access permissions

### 2. Request Organization Access (If Needed)

If you see "Organization access: Not granted" for AOP-Marketing:

1. **Click:** "Request access" next to AOP-Marketing
2. **Wait for:** Organization admin approval
3. **Alternative:** Contact your organization admin to approve the OAuth app

### 3. Organization Admin Approval

**For AOP-Marketing Admins:**

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/organizations/AOP-Marketing/settings/oauth_application_policy
2. **Find:** Rockitcode application (ID: `Ov23li4nuXpq2JjkREnk`)
3. **Click:** "Grant" or "Approve"

### 4. Test Authentication

Once approved, test the authentication:

```bash
# Navigate to your RockitCode project
cd c:\Users\topwe\Desktop\twwsites\nextjs-rockitcode

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Go to: http://localhost:3000
# Click "Login with GitHub"
# Sign in with your AOP-Marketing account
```

### 5. Verification

✅ **Check these items:**
- [ ] OAuth app appears in https://github.com/settings/applications
- [ ] AOP-Marketing organization is listed with "Granted" status
- [ ] Login works without SSO errors
- [ ] You can access the dashboard after login

## Current OAuth Configuration

```typescript
// Already configured in your app:
scopes: 'user:email read:org'  // Supports SSO organizations
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "SSO Required"
- Your organization requires SSO authentication
- Contact AOP-Marketing admin for OAuth app approval

### Error: "Insufficient Permissions"
- The `read:org` scope is needed for organization accounts
- Already configured in your app ✅

### Error: "Application Not Approved"
- Organization hasn't approved the OAuth app yet
- Wait for admin approval or contact them directly

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Personal GitHub Account
If work account continues to have issues, you can:
1. Create a personal GitHub account
2. Use it for RockitCode authentication
3. Keep work projects separate

### Option 2: Organization Settings
Ask your AOP-Marketing admin to:
1. Allow third-party OAuth applications
2. Pre-approve the RockitCode app
3. Update organization OAuth policies

## Next Steps

1. **Check organization approval status**
2. **Contact admin if needed**
3. **Test authentication once approved**
4. **Verify dashboard access**

The authentication system is fully configured and ready - it just needs organization approval for your work account.
