#### **Mobile Performance Optimization**
```typescript
// Optimized for 3G networks and budget phones
const mobileOptimizations = {
  // Lazy load code examples
  codeBlocks: 'intersection-observer',
  
  // Compress images for mobile
  imageOptimization: 'webp-with-fallback',
  
  // Minimize JavaScript bundles
  bundleStrategy: 'dynamic-imports',
  
  // Cache for offline learning
  serviceWorker: 'cache-first-lessons',
  
  // Optimize for battery life
  animations: 'reduce-motion-respect',
}
