strokeLinecap="round"
strokeLinejoin="round"
fill="none"
```

Purple: Discord
Red: Close/delete actions
Slate: GitHub, neutral actions

/* Technical Implementation */
bg-{color}-400/20 dark:bg-{color}-300/15

```

### **Animation Framework**

2. **Elegant Subtlety**: Gentle glows, not flashy effects
3. **Professional Appearance**: Clean lines, proper contrast
4. **Accessibility**: Proper sizing, color contrast, screen reader support
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more Lucide icons

### **Free Tier Strategy Preservation**
- **Current System**: ✅ COMPLETE - Do not modify

### **CRITICAL NOTE FOR FUTURE SESSIONS**
