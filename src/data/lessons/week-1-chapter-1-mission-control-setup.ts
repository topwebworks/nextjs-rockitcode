      description: "GitHub is like Google Drive for code - but way more powerful!",
      analogy: "Think of GitHub like Instagram for developers. Instead of posting photos, you post code. Instead of likes, you get job offers!",
      whyItMatters: "Every professional developer uses GitHub. It's where you store code, collaborate with others, and show off your work to employers.",
      realWorldExample: "Companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Microsoft store all their code on GitHub. When you have a GitHub profile, you're part of the same community as developers at top tech companies."

      analogy: "VS Code is to coding what Photoshop is to photo editing - the professional tool that makes everything easier and more powerful.",
      whyItMatters: "VS Code helps you write code faster, catch mistakes automatically, and even suggests code for you with AI (GitHub Copilot).",
      realWorldExample: "Over 14 million developers use VS Code daily. Google, Facebook, and Twitter developers all use VS Code to build the apps you use every day."

      title: "üîÑ What is Git? (Your Code Time Machine)",
      description: "Git tracks every change to your code, like having unlimited undo for everything you've ever written!",
      analogy: "Git is like having a magic notebook that remembers every version of every page you've ever written, and you can go back to any version at any time.",
      whyItMatters: "Git lets you experiment freely, collaborate with others, and never lose your work. It's essential for professional development.",
      realWorldExample: "When developers at Apple work on iOS, Git tracks millions of code changes from thousands of developers, making sure nothing gets lost."
