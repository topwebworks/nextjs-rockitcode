# CSS Basics: Making Your Website Beautiful

Transform your plain HTML into a stunning, professional-looking website with CSS styling.

In this lesson, you'll discover how CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) works and learn to add colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts to your HTML. By the end, your personal portfolio will look professional and polished!

## Understanding CSS: The Artist's Paintbrush for the Web

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. Think of HTML as the structure of a house (the walls, rooms, and foundation), and CSS as the interior design (paint colors, furniture, decorations). CSS is what makes websites beautiful and engaging.

### How CSS Works with HTML

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styling rules to them. It's like giving instructions to a web browser: "Make all headings blue," "Make paragraphs have bigger text," or "Add space around this section."

```css
/* This is CSS code */
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 36px;
    text-align: center;
}

p {
    color: gray;
    font-size: 18px;
    line-height: 1.5;
}
```

## Your First CSS Styles

Let's start by adding some basic styling to your "About Me" page from the previous lesson. We'll add CSS to make it look more professional and attractive.

### Step 1: Adding CSS to Your HTML

There are three ways to add CSS to HTML, but we'll use the most common method - an external CSS file.

First, create your CSS file:

```css
/* styles.css - Your first CSS file! */

/* Style the entire page */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f8f9fa;
    color: #333;
    line-height: 1.6;
}

/* Style your main heading */
h1 {
    color: #2563eb;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 42px;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
    border-bottom: 3px solid #3b82f6;
    padding-bottom: 15px;
}

/* Style your subheadings */
h2 {
    color: #7c3aed;
    font-size: 28px;
    margin-top: 40px;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
}

/* Style your paragraphs */
p {
    font-size: 18px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    text-align: justify;
}
```

### Step 2: Link CSS to Your HTML

Now update your HTML file to include the CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>About Me - [Your Name]</title>
    <!-- This line connects your CSS to your HTML -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hi, I'm [Your Name]!</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to my first web page! I'm learning how to code with HTML and CSS.</p>
    
    <p>I'm excited to discover how websites are built and create my own amazing projects.</p>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
    <p>I love pizza, video games, and learning new things!</p>
    
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>I want to become a great web developer and build cool websites.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Understanding CSS Properties

CSS is made up of **properties** and **values**. Each property controls a different aspect of how elements look:

### Colors
```css
/* Different ways to set colors */
h1 { color: blue; }           /* Named colors */
h2 { color: #ff6b6b; }        /* Hex colors */
p { color: rgb(100, 100, 100); } /* RGB colors */

/* Background colors */
body { background-color: #f8f9fa; }
```

### Fonts and Text
```css
/* Font properties */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  /* Font type */
    font-size: 18px;                 /* Text size */
    font-weight: bold;               /* Text thickness */
    text-align: center;              /* Text alignment */
    line-height: 1.6;                /* Space between lines */
}
```

### Spacing
```css
/* Margin (space outside element) and Padding (space inside element) */
h1 {
    margin: 20px;          /* Space around the element */
    padding: 15px;         /* Space inside the element */
    margin-top: 30px;      /* Space only on top */
    padding-bottom: 10px;  /* Space only on bottom */
}
```

## Try It Yourself: Style Your Portfolio

Now let's enhance your portfolio with more advanced styling. Add these styles to your `styles.css` file:

### Step 1: Add a Professional Header Section

```css
/* Create a beautiful header */
.header {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 60px 40px;
    margin: -20px -20px 40px -20px;
    border-radius: 0 0 20px 20px;
}

.header h1 {
    color: white;
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 48px;
    border: none;
    padding: 0;
}

.header p {
    font-size: 20px;
    margin: 15px 0 0 0;
    opacity: 0.9;
}
```

### Step 2: Add Section Styling

```css
/* Style your content sections */
.section {
    background: white;
    padding: 30px;
    margin: 30px 0;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.section h2 {
    color: #4a5568;
    margin-top: 0;
    font-size: 24px;
}
```

### Step 3: Update Your HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>About Me - [Your Name]</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Beautiful header section -->
    <div class="header">
        <h1>Hi, I'm [Your Name]!</h1>
        <p>Aspiring Web Developer | Learning to Code | Building Amazing Things</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- About section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm learning how to code with HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to discover how websites are built and create my own amazing projects.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Interests section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
        <p>I love pizza, video games, and learning new things! I'm passionate about technology and enjoy solving problems through code.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Goals section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to become a great web developer and build cool websites that help people and solve real problems. My dream is to work at a tech company and create applications that millions of people use.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## CSS Selectors: Targeting Elements

CSS selectors tell the browser which HTML elements to style:

### Element Selectors
```css
/* Style ALL h1 elements */
h1 {
    color: blue;
}

/* Style ALL paragraphs */
p {
    font-size: 18px;
}
```

### Class Selectors
```css
/* Style elements with class="header" */
.header {
    background-color: blue;
}

/* Style elements with class="section" */
.section {
    padding: 20px;
}
```

### ID Selectors
```css
/* Style the element with id="main-title" */
#main-title {
    font-size: 48px;
}
```
