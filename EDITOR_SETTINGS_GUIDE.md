New users see a brief tutorial explaining the layout options and how to switch between them. This tutorial can be dismissed and won't show again.

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `EditorSettingsProvider` - React context for settings state
- `EditorSettingsButton` - Full settings panel
- `QuickSettings` - Compact dropdown
- `EditorTutorial` - First-time user guide

### Settings Structure
```typescript
interface EditorSettings {
  layout: 'simple' | 'standard' | 'advanced'
  showActivityBar: boolean
  showSidebar: boolean
  showStatusBar: boolean
  showMinimap: boolean
  showOutput: boolean
  showLineNumbers: boolean

The Monaco editor component receives settings as props and updates its interface accordingly. The settings context provides keyboard shortcuts and automatic persistence.

## Usage in Lessons

Enhanced lessons automatically include:
- Quick settings dropdown in the toolbar

The editor respects the current settings and provides a consistent experience across all coding exercises.
