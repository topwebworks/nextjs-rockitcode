- Video concepts remain relevant regardless of implementation
- Code examples update automatically with curriculum updates

---

## 🎯 **Video Production Guidelines**

### **Timeless Video Content Should Cover:**

#### ✅ **DO Include in Videos:**
- **Problem-solving approaches:** "How to think about this challenge"
- **Design principles:** "Why we make these decisions"
- **Conceptual frameworks:** "The mental model for understanding this"
- **User experience considerations:** "How this affects real users"
- **Accessibility principles:** "Making this work for everyone"
- **Performance thinking:** "How to consider speed and efficiency"

#### ❌ **DON'T Include in Videos:**
- **Specific syntax:** `className` vs `class` attributes
- **Tool-specific instructions:** "Click the Webpack config button"
- **Version numbers:** "In React 18.2.0, we use..."
- **Specific file structures:** "Create a `/components/ui/` folder"
- **Framework-specific patterns:** "Use useEffect for this"

### **Example Video Script Approach:**

#### **Good (Timeless):**
> "When building navigation, we want to think about how users interact with our site across different devices. The core principle is progressive disclosure - show what's most important first, then reveal additional options as needed. Let's explore how to create a navigation system that adapts to user context..."

#### **Bad (Too Specific):**
> "Open your terminal and run `npm install @headlessui/react`. Then create a file called `Navigation.tsx` in your components folder. Import the Disclosure component from HeadlessUI..."
