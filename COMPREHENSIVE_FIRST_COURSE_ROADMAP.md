```
🎬 Hero Video (5 min) - Shows WHAT they'll build and WHY it matters
    ↓
🧠 Concept Introduction - Learn ONE fundamental concept
    ↓
🔬 Interactive Lab - Experiment with concept in playground
    ↓
💡 Guided Practice - Apply concept to solve simple problems
    ↓
🔨 Building Challenge - Use concept to create part of target solution

- **Learning Path Design** - Optimal sequence from zero to target code competency
- **Practice Variations** - Multiple ways to practice each concept for different learning styles
- **Assessment Clarity** - Clear success criteria for each concept and combined application

#### **🔍 Example: Guided Code Discovery in Action**

**Target Code We Want Students to Write (HTML Navigation):**
```html
<nav class="navbar">
  <div class="nav-container">
    <h1 class="nav-logo">MyPortfolio</h1>
    <ul class="nav-menu">
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a href="#about" class="nav-link">About</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a href="#projects" class="nav-link">Projects</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a href="#contact" class="nav-link">Contact</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
```

**🎮 Discovery Process:**

**Step 1: Concept Introduction - "What are HTML Tags?"**
- Interactive Lab: "Try typing `<h1>Hello</h1>` in the editor"
- Watch it render: "Hello" appears as a large heading
- Practice: Create headings h1, h2, h3 with different text
- Understanding: Tags wrap content and give it meaning

**Step 2: Concept Introduction - "What are Lists?"**
- Interactive Lab: "Try typing `<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>`"
- Watch it render: Bulleted list appears
- Practice: Create lists with different items
- Understanding: Lists organize related information

**Step 3: Concept Introduction - "What are Links?"**
- Interactive Lab: "Try typing `<a href="#section">Click me</a>`"
- Watch it render: Clickable link appears
- Practice: Create links to different sections
- Understanding: Links connect to other parts of the page

**Step 4: Concept Introduction - "What are CSS Classes?"**
- Interactive Lab: "Add `class="big-text"` to your heading"
- CSS automatically styles it differently
- Practice: Add classes to different elements
- Understanding: Classes let us style elements

**Step 5: Building Challenge - "Create a Simple Menu"**
- Goal: "Make a list of 3 links for a website menu"
- Students apply learned concepts:
  - Use `<ul>` for the list structure
  - Use `<li>` for each menu item
  - Use `<a>` for clickable links
  - Add classes for styling
- No templates - they write the code using what they learned

**Step 6: Advanced Concept - "Semantic HTML"**
- Interactive Lab: "Replace `<div>` with `<nav>` for navigation"
- Understanding: `<nav>` tells browsers "this is navigation"
- Practice: Use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`

**Step 7: Master Challenge - "Build Professional Navigation"**
- Goal: "Create navigation that looks like professional websites"
- Students combine ALL learned concepts:
  - Semantic `<nav>` wrapper
  - Container `<div>` for layout
  - `<h1>` for site logo
  - `<ul>` list for menu items
  - `<a>` links with proper attributes
  - CSS classes for professional styling

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- Student writes the exact target code using learned concepts
- Student explains WHY each tag is used
- Student can modify the navigation for different scenarios
- Student understands the pattern for building similar components

## 🎓 **INTERACTIVE LESSON ARCHITECTURE** *(Implemented & Production Ready)*

### **📚 Current Implementation Status**

#### **✅ COMPLETED: Mission Control Setup (Week 1, Chapter 1)**
- **File**: `src/components/lessons/InteractiveLessonRenderer.tsx`
- **Data**: `src/data/lessons/week-1-chapter-1-mission-control-setup.ts`
- **Test Route**: `/interactive-test`
- **Status**: Fully functional, mobile-optimized, production-ready

### **🏗️ Interactive Lesson Component Architecture**

#### **Core Design Principles**
1. **Mobile-First Responsive**: Works perfectly down to 320px width
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Simple → Complex as students advance
3. **Toggle-Based Completion**: Students can mark/unmark completion for honest self-assessment
4. **Celebration-Driven**: Achievement unlocks and progress celebrations
5. **Accessibility-First**: High contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly

#### **Component Structure**
```
InteractiveLessonRenderer.tsx
├── Header Section (Progress, Title, Description)
├── Navigation Section (Fluid responsive lab navigation)
├── Lab Content Section (Current lab with instructions)
├── Completion Section (Toggle completion button)
├── Achievement Section (Progress tracking and celebrations)
└── Modal System (Achievement unlock celebrations)
```

#### **Navigation System** *(Optimized for All Screen Sizes)*
```typescript
// Fluid responsive navigation with CSS clamp()
.lab-nav-container {
  gap: clamp(0.25rem, 2vw, 1.5rem); // 4px to 24px fluid spacing
}
.lab-nav-button {
  width: clamp(1.5rem, 8vw, 2rem);  // 24px to 32px fluid size
  height: clamp(1.5rem, 8vw, 2rem);
}
```

**Features:**
- **Arrow Navigation**: Small left/right icons for Previous/Next
- **Numbered Labs**: Visual progress indicators (1-7)
- **Completion Status**: ✓ for completed, numbers for incomplete
- **Responsive Spacing**: Automatically adjusts spacing based on screen width
- **Horizontal Scroll**: Clean scrolling on very narrow screens

#### **Completion System** *(Toggle-Based for Honest Learning)*
```typescript
const handleLabCompletion = async (labId: string) => {
  const isAlreadyCompleted = completedLabs.includes(labId)
  
  if (isAlreadyCompleted) {
    // TOGGLE OFF: Remove from completed (honest self-assessment)
    const newCompletedLabs = completedLabs.filter(id => id !== labId)
    setCompletedLabs(newCompletedLabs)
    return
  }
  
  // TOGGLE ON: Mark as complete, trigger achievements, advance
  // ...achievement logic
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Students can unmark labs if they realize they didn't complete properly
- Encourages honest self-reflection
- No penalty for toggling - maintains accurate progress tracking

#### **Achievement System**
```typescript
// Achievement mapping based on lab completion
const achievementTriggers = {
  'first-github-account': 'github-account-creation',
  'student-pack-unlocked': 'student-pack-activation',
  'first-code-written': 'first-code-creation',
  'first-commit-made': 'git-workflow-practice',
  'first-deployment': 'github-pages-deployment'
}
```

**Visual Design:**
- Clean achievement cards without redundant icons
- Progress tracking with percentage completion
- Celebration modal with gentle animations (no bouncing buttons!)
- "Unlocked!" badges without duplicate checkmarks

### **🎨 Visual Design System**

#### **Color Contrast & Accessibility**
```css
/* Links optimized for dark backgrounds */
.lesson-link {
  @apply text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 
         hover:text-blue-800 dark:hover:text-blue-300;
}
```

#### **Animation Philosophy**
- **Static Elements**: Buttons, modals, core UI (no bouncing that impairs usability)
- **Celebration Elements**: Trophy icons, achievement unlocks (gentle bounce only)
- **Progress Elements**: Smooth transitions, fade-ins, scale hovers

#### **Mobile Optimization**
- **320px Minimum**: All components tested and optimized for smallest modern screens
- **Fluid Typography**: Uses `clamp()` for responsive text sizing
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets maintained
- **Performance**: Minimal animations, optimized renders

### **📊 Data Structure Design**

#### **Lesson Schema** (`InteractiveLesson` Interface)
```typescript
interface InteractiveLesson {
  lessonId: string
  week: number
  chapter: number
  title: string
  description: string
  estimatedTime: string
  
  // Core Learning Components
  concepts: ConceptIntroduction[]
