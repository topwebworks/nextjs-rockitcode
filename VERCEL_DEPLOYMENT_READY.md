## 📈 **MONITORING STRATEGY**

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
```
📊 Function Invocations: <700K/month (70% of limit)
💾 Bandwidth Usage: <70GB/month (70% of limit)
⚡ CPU Time: <168 minutes/month (70% of limit)
🌐 Edge Requests: <700K/month (70% of limit)
```

### **Vercel Dashboard Monitoring:**
```
1. Monitor function usage weekly
2. Track bandwidth consumption daily
3. Check CPU time usage monthly
4. Review performance metrics regularly
5. Set up alerts at 80% usage
```

### **Performance Optimization:**
```
🔍 WEEKLY CHECKS:
- Function invocation trends
- Page load performance
- User experience metrics
- Error rates and debugging

📊 MONTHLY REVIEWS:
- Overall usage against limits
- Optimization opportunities  
- Feature usage analytics
- Cost optimization analysis
```

## 🚨 **ALERT THRESHOLDS**

### **Usage Alerts:**
```
🟡 WARNING (80% of limits):
- Functions: 800K/month
- Bandwidth: 80GB/month  
- CPU: 192 minutes/month

🔴 CRITICAL (90% of limits):
- Functions: 900K/month
